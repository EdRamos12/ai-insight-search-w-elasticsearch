                Before Sunrise, a 1995 romantic drama film that Before Sunset is a sequel to, The Mirror Has Two Faces, a 1996 American romantic dramedy film, and Get Real, a 1998 British romantic comedy-drama film about the coming of age of a gay teen.
                
                The Mirror Has Two Faces is a 1996 American romantic dramedy film written by Richard LaGravenese, based on the 1958 French film Le Miroir Ã  Deux Faces.
